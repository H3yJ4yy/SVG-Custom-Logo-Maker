  ## Description
  This helps the user create their own monogram logo within their own time thanks to the help of this application. With the help of `Inquirer`, the user will be asked to answer questions to determine how they would like their logo to look like, like what letters they want to use (up to 3) to what colors they would like, and what shape to use (circle, square, or triangle). Once all questions have been answered, an SVG file will have been created, containing the users brand new logo!

  `inquirer 8.2.4` and
